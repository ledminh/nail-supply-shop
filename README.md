# Nail Supply Shop - First Iteration

Welcome to the first iteration of the Nail Supply Shop, a project developed using Next.js. This marks my first attempt at creating a fully functional web application. Before this, my experience was limited to smaller toy projects and simple applications without a meaningful purpose.

In this initial version of the project, all data is hardcoded within the application itself, without the use of a database or external API. The primary goal was to gain a fundamental understanding of the application's structure and appearance.
